    Goal: develop an invariant-confluence decision procedure.
  \end{center}

  \note{%
    Now that we've defined invariant confluence, we can turn our attention to
    the main goal of our paper. And that is to develop an invariant-confluence
    decision procedure. As you saw in the previos example, determining whether
    or not a distributed object is invariant confluent is not easy to do by
    hand, so we'd like to develop a decision procedure that can automatically
    check whether something is invariant confluent for us.

  \note{%
    Unfortunately, developing an invariant confluence decision procedure
    straight up is not easy. Invariant confluence is fundamentally a property
    about reachable states but reasoning automatically about reachable states
    is hard. \\[12pt]

    Instead of reasoning about invariant confluence directly then, we'll look
    at a sufficient condition for invariant confluence called invariant
    closure. \\[12pt]

    Unlike invariant confluence, we'll see that invariant closure is easy to
    check. \\[12pt]

  We say a set $S$ is \defword{closed under $f$} if for every $x, y \in S, f(x,
  y) \in S$. \pause For example,
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Even numbers are closed under addition.
    \item Odd numbers are \emph{not} closed under addition.
  \end{itemize}

  \note{%
    First, a quick refresher on what it meas for a set to be closed. We say a
    set $S$ is closed under a binary operator $f$ if for every $x$ and $y$ in
    $S$, $f(x, y)$ is also in $S$. For example, even numbers are closed under
    addition because the sum of any two even numbers is even. But odd numbers
    are not closed under addition because the sum of two odd numbers may not
    be odd.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      $O = (S, \join)$ is \defword{\invariantclosed{}} with respect to an
      invariant $I$ if invariant satisfying states are closed under merge.
    \pause\item
      For every state $s_1, s_2 \in S$, if $I(s_1)$ and $I(s_2)$, then $I(s_1
      \join s_2)$.
  \end{itemize}

  \note{%
    We say that an object $O$ is invariant closed if invariant satisfying
    states are closed under merge. That is, if an object is invariant closed,
    then for every pair of states $s_1$ and $s_2$, if $s_1$ and $s_2$ satisfy
    the invariant then so does $s_1 \join s_2$.

  \pause

  Why?

  \pause
  Transactions maintain the invariant. If merging does as well, then the
  invariant is always maintained.

  \note{%
    As I mentioned earlier, invariant closure is a sufficient condition for
    invariant confluence. I'll refer you to the paper for the proof, but it's a
    very simple proof.
