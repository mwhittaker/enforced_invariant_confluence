Changes

- Technical report content.
- Clarified that the merge operator does not need to satisfy any special
  properties like associativity or commutativity.
- Proved that our definition of invariant confluence is equivalent to the
  original definition given by Bailis et al.
- Added formal proof that invariant closure is sufficient for invariant
  confluence.
- Expanded interactive decision procedure correctness proof.
- Added example of a merge-reducible object.
- Added example of a non merge-reducible object.
- Added proof that merge-reducibility is sufficient for invariant-confluence.
- Demonstrated that merge-reducibility is not a necessary condition for
  invariant-confluence.
- Expanded proof that merge reducibility is sufficient for invariant
  confluence.
- Added figure summarizing relationship between invariant confluence, invariant
  closure, merge reducibility, and criteria 1-4.
- Added example of co-reachability.
