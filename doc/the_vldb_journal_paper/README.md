Changes

- Technical report content.
- Clarified that the merge operator does not need to satisfy any special
  properties like associativity or commutativity.
- Proved that our definition of invariant confluence is equivalent to the
  original definition given by Bailis et al.
- Added formal proof that invariant closure is sufficient for invariant
  confluence.
