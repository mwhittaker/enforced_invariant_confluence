\section{Interactive \Iconfluence{} Decision Procedure}
\clmref{sufficientandnecessary} arms us with some potent understanding of
\Iconfluence! Imagine we have an \Iclosed{} decision procedure that informs us
that our state-based object from \exampleref{statebasednotnecessary} is not
\Iclosed{}. Without \clmref{sufficientandnecessary}, we'd be a bit stuck. We'd
have to seek out alternative means to determine whether or not our transactions
were \Iconfluent{}. With the intuition provided by
\clmref{sufficientandnecessary}, we can instead restrict our invariant to $I =
\setst{(x, y)}{xy \leq 0 \land x \geq 0 \land y \leq 0}$. Now, the \Iclosed{}
decision procedure informs us that we are indeed \Iclosed{}, so we know we're
\Iconfluent{}.
