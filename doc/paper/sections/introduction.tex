\section{Introduction}
In summary, our contributions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    We propose a novel expression-oriented definition of invariant-confluence
    that is both formal and simple (\secref{InvariantConfluence}).

  \item
    We develop conditions under which invariant-closure is both necessary and
    sufficient for invariant-confluence (\secref{InvariantClosure}).

  \item
    We exploit these conditions to design an interactive decision procedure for
    invariant-confluence (\secref{InteractiveDecisionProcedure}).

  \item
    We again exploit these conditions to design a novel non-trivial sufficient
    condition for invariant-confluence that does not depend on user interaction
    (\secref{???}).

  \item
    We present segmented invariant-confluence: a generalization of
    invariant-confluence that uses a small amount of coordination to maintain
    invariants for replicated objects that are otherwise not
    invariant-confluent (\secref{SegmentedInvariantConfluence}).

  \item
    We implement and evaluate our theoretical findings in a system called Lucy
    (\secref{Evaluation}).
\end{itemize}

% Hype up problem that invariant confluence solves
% Introduce iconfluence and hype it up as a really good thing.
% Discuss how it's hard to determine iconfluence and a lot of existing
% approaches fall short.
% Describe how we take the problem one step further
% Overview two new approaches
% Describe how often times we're not iconfluent
% Overivew new segmented iconfluence stuff
% contributions
%   - new expression-based definitions of iconfluence
%   - understanding of iclosure and new suff and necc
%   - interactive decision procedure
%   - new suff conditions
%   - segmented iconfluence
%   - implementation in lucy + evaluation...
